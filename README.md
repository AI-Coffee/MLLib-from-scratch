<h1 align="center"> Machine Learning Library from Scratch with Python</h1>

## Introduction

This is my first project on my blog, [AICoffee](https://ai-coffee.github.io/). In this project, I will "re-built from scratch" state-of-the-art algorithms in ML/DL, but using only Python language. I will use **NumPy library** for better performance on matrix calculation.

One thing you need to know that, I make this project **just for learning and understanding algorithms deeply**, not suitable to apply in real-world problems. I still recommend using many other SOTA libraries for building models.
